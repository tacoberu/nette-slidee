Nette Slidee
============

Simple slide for Nette. Little thing for making web sites in the oldschool style.

Many credits to David Grudl and Nette Foundation (https://doc.nette.org).

The points is, you are not creating any complex abstractions as many software guys nowdays like to do.
It is more simply, one webpage is one template.

But when you need, you can add whatever: components, servises, and all those timey wimey stuff by useing DI container.
